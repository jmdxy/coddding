/**
 * Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.
 * <p>
 * According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w
 * as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
 * <p>

 *  6      _2       0       8

 * 7   4
 * </pre>
 * For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 5 and 1 is 3. Another example is LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5,
 * since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

     * node is one of the two nodes, it must be the LCA of the two nodes. If not, we count the number of nodes that
     * matches either p or q in the left subtree (which we call totalMatches). If totalMatches equals 1, then we know
     * the right subtree will contain the other node. Therefore, the current node must be the LCA. If totalMatches
     * equals 2, we know that both nodes are contained in the left subtree, so we traverse to its left child. Similar
     * with the case where totalMatches equals 0 where we traverse to its right child.
