/**
 * 经典的BFS算法
 * <p>
 * Given a snake and ladder board, find the minimum number of dice throws required to reach the destination or last
 * cell from source or 1st cell. Basically, the player has total control over outcome of dice throw and wants to find
 * out minimum number of throws required to reach last cell.
 * <p>
 * If the player reaches a cell which is base of a ladder, the player has to climb up that ladder and if reaches a
 * cell is mouth of the snake, has to go down to the tail of snake without a dice throw.
 * <p>
 * snakesladders
 * <p>
 * For example consider the board shown on right side (taken from here), the minimum number of dice throws required
 * to reach cell 30 from cell 1 is 3. Following are steps.
 * <p>
 * a) First throw two on dice to reach cell number 3 and then ladder to reach 22
 * b) Then throw 6 to reach 28.
 * c) Finally through 2 to reach 30.
 * <p>
 * There can be other solutions as well like (2, 2, 6), (2, 4, 4), (2, 3, 5).. etc.
 * <p>
 * We strongly recommend to minimize the browser and try this yourself first.
 * The idea is to consider the given snake and ladder board as a directed graph with number of vertices equal to the
 * number of cells in the board. The problem reduces to finding the shortest path in a graph. Every vertex of the
 * graph has an edge to next six vertices if next 6 vertices do not have a snake or ladder. If any of the next six
 * vertices has a snake or ladder, then the edge from current vertex goes to the top of the ladder or tail of the
 * snake. Since all edges are of equal weight, we can efficiently find shortest path using Breadth First Search of
 * the graph.
 * <p>
 * Following is C++ implementation of the above idea. The input is represented by two things, first is ‘N’ which is
 * number of cells in the given board, second is an array ‘move[0…N-1]’ of size N. An entry move[i] is -1 if there is
 * no snake and no ladder from i, otherwise move[i] contains index of destination cell for the snake or the ladder at i.
