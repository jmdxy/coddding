/**
 * <p>
 * This application demonstrates the async method invocation pattern. Key parts of the pattern are
 * <code>AsyncResult</code> which is an intermediate container for an asynchronously evaluated value,
 * <code>AsyncCallback</code> which can be provided to be executed on task completion and
 * <code>AsyncExecutor</code> that manages the execution of the async tasks.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The main method shows example flow of async invocations. The main thread starts multiple tasks with
 * variable durations and then continues its own work. When the main thread has done it's job it collects
 * the results of the async tasks. Two of the tasks are handled with callbacks, meaning the callbacks are
 * executed immediately when the tasks complete.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Noteworthy difference of thread usage between the async results and callbacks is that the async results
 * are collected in the main thread but the callbacks are executed within the worker threads. This should be
 * noted when working with thread pools.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Java provides its own implementations of async method invocation pattern. FutureTask, CompletableFuture
 * and ExecutorService are the real world implementations of this pattern. But due to the nature of parallel
 * programming, the implementations are not trivial. This example does not take all possible scenarios into
 * account but rather provides a simple version that helps to understand the pattern.
 * </p>
